# Snake Game in Python

## Introduction
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Python using the tkinter graphics library. It is designed for beginners who want to learn the basics of game development in Python.

## How to Play
To play the Snake game, follow these instructions:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the files.
4. Run the `snake.py` file using Python.
5. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
6. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
7. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the game becomes more challenging.
8. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using tkinter.
- Game loop to control the flow of the game.
- Key press events to move the snake in different directions.
- List data structure to store the snake's segments.
- Collision detection to check for collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
- Game over condition when the snake collides with walls or itself.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
